%version_information2
====================

IPython magic extension for showing version information for dependency modules in
a notebook.

See the
[example notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/jrjohansson/version_information/master/example.ipynb)
for intallation instruction and example of how to use this magic extension.

This is a maintained fork of the [original project created by @jrjohansson](https://github.com/jrjohansson/version_information) to fix some bugs that were preventing the package from running in Python 3.8 and later. Not a ton of time to dedicate to the project but will try to keep it running in the current version of python. Renamed to version_information2 because the package is abandoned in pypi.
